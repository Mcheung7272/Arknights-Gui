# Arknights-Materials-Gui
A gui I made to interact with my code that displays elite materials needed for the game Arknights. I used Selenium to scrape the pages containing all the information for each operator in the game. I cropped the specific area where the materials were, and saved that.
I created the gui with Tkinter.
## Usage
Relatively straightforward, the gui takes in the name of an operator and displays the necessary materials needed for each elite transformation.
